    "It was initially developed to explain phase transitions in magnetism but has since been applied to a wide range of complex systems, including neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Idea\n",
    "- Consider a **grid (lattice)** where each point represents a **spin**.\n",
    "- Each spin can take one of two states: **up (+1) or down (-1)**.\n",
    "- Spins interact with their neighbors, aiming to align in a way that minimizes system energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interaction and Energy Minimization\n",
    "- The system's total energy is determined by how well-aligned the spins are with their neighbors.\n",
    "- The **Hamiltonian** (energy function) for the Ising model is:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  H = - \\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} s_i s_j\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - $s_i$ represents the spin at site $i$.\n",
    "  - $J_{ij}$ is the coupling strength between neighboring spins.  \n",
